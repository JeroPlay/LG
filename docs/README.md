# LaserGame
#### Short Summary:
A game based on [ESP8266 â€“ Witty Cloud Moduls](https://www.ebay.de/itm/ESP8266-Serial-WIFI-Witty-Cloud-Development-Board-ESP-12F-Module-MINI-nodemcu/173615398063?_trkparms=aid%3D1110001%26algo%3DSPLICE.SIM%26ao%3D2%26asc%3D20160323102634%26meid%3D3aa4e928f3964fcbb2f8c6cbc12c2c0f%26pid%3D100623%26rk%3D2%26rkt%3D6%26sd%3D222081069541%26itm%3D173615398063%26pmt%3D0%26noa%3D1%26pg%3D2047675&_trksid=p2047675.c100623.m-1), ESP-Now and a laser pointer. The goal of the game is to hit the blinking ESPs with the laser gun and reach a high score of hits.
It's like Laser Tag on fixed targets with a real laser.

If you ever want to shoot with a laser pointer at an actual target, this game is a cheap version to try this out and learn more about Mc's and ESP-Now.

### Installing Instructions

1. Download the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software) and install it. ([Install Guide](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/HomePage))

2. Add the needed libraries. (`LG/Installation/..`) 

   - ESP8266 ([How to add libraries](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/how-to-install-esp8266-board-arduino-ide/))
   - Color   &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;([How to add .zip - libraries](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries))  (The library is in the installation directory)
   
3. Connect the ESP8266 that will be the server host to your PC.

   - Make sure your tool settings are correct (Port could be different)
   
   -![Settings in Tools](../SecretFiles/Settings%20for%20Tools.png)

4. Open the [GetServerMac](../Installation/GetServerMac)-program in the IDE

5. Upload the program to the ESP. (`Ctrl + U`)

6. Open the serial monitor. (`Ctrl + Shift + M` or `Tools -> Serial Monitor` )

7. Copy the AP MAC and the STA MAC from the console to the [Server-Mac.txt](../Installation/Server-Mac.txt) file.

   ```
   Console Output Example:
   ===========================================================
   Gameserver
   -----------------------------------------------------------
   This node AP mac:  AF:FA:BC:02:E6:CD
   This node STA mac: AC:FA:BC:02:E6:CD
   ===========================================================
   ```
   
  8. Open [LGGameserver](../Game/LGGameserver/LGGameserver.ino) with the Arduino IDE.
  
  9. Upload the program to the ESP. (`Ctrl + U`)
  
 10. Open [LGTarget](../Game/LGTarget/LGTarget.ino) with the Arduino IDE.
 
 11. Change the server Mac addresses for the targets (**don't** copy paste complete mac.txt) `(Code row : 71 - 72)`
 `
  
       // server esp mac addresses for the targets
       #ifdef TARGET

       uint8_t GAMESERVER_ap_mac[]   = {0xEE, 0xFA, 0xBC, 0x0C, 0xE6, 0xAF}; 
       uint8_t GAMESERVER_sta_mac[]  = {0xEC, 0xFA, 0xBC, 0x0C, 0xE6, 0xAF};

       // init sensor val
       int initVal;

       #endif
`
    
 12. Connect an ESP8266 that will be one of the targets.
 
 13. Upload the program to the ESP. (`Ctrl + U`)
 
 14. Repeat the steps 12 and 13 for every target.
 
 15. Installation completed.

      
 ### The 2 versions
 
 The project includes two versions of code. The first one is the complete code in on .ino file so you have everything concentrated. 
 For reverse-engineer, this version is pretty confusing and it is just for a fast and easy import and installation.
 The second code is separated into two programs - the server program and the target program. It is easier to understand and to reverse-engineer.
 It is up to you which version you want to use. Both have the same program sequences.
 
 VERSION 1 : [LG_AllInOne](../Game/LG_AllInOne)
 
 VERSION 2 : [LG_Server_Target](../Game/LG_Server_Target)

## Side Notes
* If you want some printouts on the console, use the \*DV (_DebugVersion_)
* The maximum number of targets per game is now limited to 40 but I haven't tried more than 14 (but it should work with more too)
