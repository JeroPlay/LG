#### Short Summary:
A game based on [ESP8266 â€“ Witty Cloud Moduls](https://www.ebay.de/itm/ESP8266-Serial-WIFI-Witty-Cloud-Development-Board-ESP-12F-Module-MINI-nodemcu/173615398063?_trkparms=aid%3D1110001%26algo%3DSPLICE.SIM%26ao%3D2%26asc%3D20160323102634%26meid%3D3aa4e928f3964fcbb2f8c6cbc12c2c0f%26pid%3D100623%26rk%3D2%26rkt%3D6%26sd%3D222081069541%26itm%3D173615398063%26pmt%3D0%26noa%3D1%26pg%3D2047675&_trksid=p2047675.c100623.m-1), ESP-Now and a laser pointer. The goal of the game is to hit the blinking ESPs with the laser gun and reach a high score of hits.
It's like lasertag on fixed targets with a real laser.
